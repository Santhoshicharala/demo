            BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys, is an acronym for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan, meaning Bulletproof Boy Scouts.
             In July 2017,they announced they'd also be known as Beyond the Scene as part of their new identity. 
            The seven-member band was formed through auditions by Bit Hit Entertainment in 2010 and 2011, and finalized in 2012. 
            BTS made their musical debut in 2013 with the first of their school trilogy series, their single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool.
            The group quickly became one of the hottest acts in South Korea, winning several New Artist of the Year awards.

        <h3>What is ARMY?</h3>
        <p>
            ARMY (a fitting name for the organized passion of BTS fans) is actually an acronym for Adorable Representative MC for Youth.
        </p>
        <h3>Who are BTS?</h3>
        <p>
            BTS are a K-pop (or Korean pop) group made up of seven members-Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook who come from all over South Korea.
            They launched in 2013 and have since rocketed to global stardom.Over the years, the group have produced material around various themes starting with the 'School' trilogy.
            This was followed by the 'Most Beautiful Moment in Life', 'Wings', and most recently, the 'Love Yourself' series.
            Their album 'Love Yourself: Answer' stormed to the top of the US charts, which saw South Korean President Moon Jae-in taking to Twitter to congratulate the boys on their success.
            BTS is the biggest K-pop group internationally - and it doesn't look like they're stopping any time soon.

        <h3>Why are BTS so successful?</h3>
        <p>
            There are four reasons that BTS have become as popular as they have.
        </p>
            
            <h4>1. The music</h4>
            <p>
                According to Billboard, their album 'Love Yourself: Tear', which is sung in Korean, became "the first primarily foreign-language No 1 album in over 12 years."
                Not only that, but many people say that the subject of their music has played a part in their success.While many K-pop songs are about relationships and love, BTS cover subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism and mental health.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Their performance</h4>
            <p>
                There's no point having amazing songs if you can't sell them to the world - and BTS have got this down to a fine art.With their slick dance routines and extremely impressive music videos, they've attracted a loyal group of fans who have fallen in love with their music even more.
                Mr Son, the band's choreographer, explains: "Music videos seem to be one of the most important factors. Messages from an artist can be delivered more effectively."
                To polish their performances, BTS practice for hours. For their debut performance, they were working at it for 12 to 15 hours a day to get it right. Well, it certainly paid off!
            </p>
            <h4>3. The internet</h4>
            <p>
                The internet - and in particular social media - has played an enormous part in the success of the group.Suga told BBC Radio 1: "I think we're so lucky to be born at the right time. Without social media, we wouldn't have been so successful."
                In 2018, the boys won a Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist, beating huge names like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez.They were the first K-Pop group to win one.
               "We still cannot believe that we are standing here on this stage at the Billboard Music Awards," the group said in their acceptance speech.
            </p>
            <h4>4. The fans</h4>
        <p>
            No band can have success without its fans and BTS has some of the most loyal, dedicated fans that the world has EVER seen with 19.4 million followers on Twitter and 23.7 million on Instagram.
            Known as the ARMY, it was the fans who cast an unbelievable 300 million online votes to ensure that the group won their Billboard award. And in Autumn 2017, they watched the video for 'DNA' 50 million times on YouTube in just one month!
             With numerous pages, profiles and sites set up all over the world by adoring followers, fans spend hours posting content, sending messages and sharing their love for the seven boys
